Talismane
=========

Natural language processing framework including a default implementation for a French syntax parser.

A current working JAR with all dependencies can be downloaded at the [CLLE-ERSS laboratory Talismane project home page](http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/applications/talismane.html "Talismane project home page").

A full users's manual can be found on the [GitHub Talismane project page](http://urieli.github.io/talismane/ "GitHub Talismane project page").

The default French implementation can be used for research purposes provided that you have a license for the French Treebank.
The model included is not optimised as it uses a Maximum Entropy model (which only requires about 1G of RAM) rather than a Linear SVM model (which requires about 24G RAM).
If you would like the more optimised Linear SVM model, please contact [Assaf Urieli](mailto:assaf.urieli@gmail.com "Assaf Urieli").

The default English implementation can be used for research purposes provided that you have a license for the Penn Treebank.
WARNING: the English model is only an initial version, with no attempts at optimisation.

For more information on usage permissions, see the license files.
