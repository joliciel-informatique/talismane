###### CONSTRAINTS ######
# Automatically attach punctuation to the first potential governor (we don't care about punctuation attachment,
# and this keeps the beam from cluttering with useless punctuation attachment options).
# Unfortunately, we have to leave out commas, since they can have a label of "coord" as well as "ponct"
RightArc[ponct]	PosTag(Buffer[0])=="PONCT" & Not(LexicalForm(Buffer[0])==",")
# After we perform the RightArc above, and generally for any punctuation decision (commas as well), we reduce the stack to allow further parsing
Reduce	DependencyLabel(Stack[0])=="ponct"
# If after all that we still don't have a dependent, we apply a LeftArc on the punctuation (should only occur with punct at start of sentence).
LeftArc[ponct]	PosTag(Stack[0])=="PONCT" & Not(LexicalForm(Stack[0])==",")
