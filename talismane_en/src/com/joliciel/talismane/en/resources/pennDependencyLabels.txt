ADV	(adverbial) - marks a constituent other than ADVP or PP when it is used adverbially (e.g. NPs or free ("headless" relatives). . However, constituents that themselves are modifying an ADVP generally do not get -ADV. If a more specific tag is available (for example, -TMP) then it is used alone and -ADV is implied. 
ADV-GAP	
AMOD	
AMOD-GAP	
APPO	
BNF	(benefactive) - marks the beneficiary of an action (attaches to NP or PP). This tag is used only when (1) the verb can undergo dative shift and (2) the prepositional variant (with the same meaning) uses for. The prepositional objects of dative-shifting verbs with other prepositions than for (such as to or of) are annotated -DTV.
#CLF	(cleft) - marks it-clefts ("true clefts") and may be added to the labels S, SINV, or SQ.
#CLR	(closely related) - marks constituents that occupy some middle ground between arguments and adjunct of the verb phrase. These roughly correspond to "predication adjuncts", prepositional ditransitives, and some "phrasel verbs". 
CONJ	
COORD	
DEP	
DEP-GAP	
DIR	(direction) - marks adverbials that answer the questions "from where?" and "to where?" It implies motion, which can be metaphorical as in "...rose 5 pts. to 57-1/2" or "increased 70% to 5.8 billion yen" -DIR is most often used with verbs of motion/transit and financial verbs.
DIR-GAP	
DIR-PRD	
DTV	(dative) - marks the dative object in the unshifted form of the double object construction. If the preposition introducing the "dative" object is for, it is considered benefactive (-BNF). -DTV (and -BNF) is only used after verbs that can undergo dative shift.
#EXP	expletive
EXT	(extent) - marks adverbial phrases that describe the spatial extent of an activity. -EXT was incorporated primarily for cases of movement in financial space, but is also used in analogous situations elsewhere. Obligatory complements do not receive -EXT. Words such as fully and completely are absolutes and do not receive -EXT. 
EXT-GAP	
EXTR	
#GAP	gapping
GAP-LGS	
GAP-LOC	
GAP-LOC-PRD	
GAP-MNR	
GAP-NMOD	
GAP-OBJ	
GAP-OPRD	
GAP-PMOD	
GAP-PRD	
GAP-SBJ	
GAP-TMP	
GAP-VC	
#HLN	(headline) - marks headlines and datelines. Note that headlines and datelines always constitute a unit of text that is structurally independent from the following sentence.
IM	
#IOBJ
LGS	(logical subject) - is used to mark the logical subject in passives. It attaches to the NP object of by and not to the PP node itself.
LOC	(locative) - marks adverbials that indicate place/setting of the event. -LOC may also indicate metaphorical location. There is likely to be some varation in the use of -LOC due to differing annotator interpretations. In cases where the annotator is faced with a choice between -LOC or -TMP, the default is -LOC. In cases involving SBAR, SBAR should not receive -LOC. -LOC has some uses that are not adverbial, such as with place names that are adjoined to other NPs and NAC-LOC premodifiers of NPs. 
LOC-OPRD	
LOC-PRD	
MNR	(manner) - marks adverbials that indicate manner, including instrument phrases.
NAME	
NMOD	
#NOM	(nominal) - marks free ("headless") relatives and gerunds when they act nominally.
OBJ	
OPRD	
P	
PMOD	
POSTHON	
PRD	(predicate) - marks any predicate that is not VP. In the do so construction, the so is annotated as a predicate.
PRD-PRP	
PRD-TMP	
PRN	
PRP	(purpose or reason) - marks purpose or reason clauses and PPs.
PRT	
PUT	- marks the locative complement of put. 
ROOT	
#ROOT-FRAG
#ROOT-S
#ROOT-SBARQ
#ROOT-SQ
SBJ	(surface subject) - marks the structural surface subject of both matrix and embedded clauses, including those with null subjects.
SUB	
SUFFIX	
TITLE	
TMP	(temporal) - marks temporal or aspectual adverbials that answer the questions when, how often, or how long. It has some uses that are not strictly adverbial, auch as with dates that modify other NPs at S- or VP-level. In cases of apposition involving SBAR, the SBAR should not be labeled -TMP. Only in "financialspeak," and only when the dominating PP is a PP-DIR, may temporal modifiers be put at PP object level. Note that -TMP is not used in possessive phrases. 
#TPC	("topicalized") - marks elements that appear before the subject in a declarative sentence, but in two cases only: 1. if the front element is associated with a *T* in the position of the gap. 2. if the fronted element is left-dislocated (i.e. it is associated with a resumptive pronoun in the position of the gap). 
#TTL	(title) - is attached to the top node of a title when this title appears inside running text. -TTL implies -NOM. The internal structure of the title is bracketed as usual.
VC
#VMOD
VOC	(vocative) - marks nouns of address, regardless of their position in the sentence. It is not coindexed to the subject and not get -TPC when it is sentence-initial.
