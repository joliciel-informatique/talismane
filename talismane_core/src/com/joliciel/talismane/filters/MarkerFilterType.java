 * An action to take by a particular TextMarkerFilter.<br/>
 * These actions are either stack based or unary.<br/>
 * Stack-based actions can be nested.<br/>
 * Unary actions (e.g. start and end markers) only affect the current top of stack.<br/>
 * For maximum robustness, the best strategy is to reserve stack-based markers for
 * very short segments, and use unary markers instead of excessive nesting.<br/>
